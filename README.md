# SpreadsheetJS [WIP]
A Library specializing in reading Spreadsheet data, based in Typescript (4.2.3 - ES2020, Node : 10.14.0)
* Focused on just reading, does not support writing.
* Supported formats as of now : .xls , xlsx 
* Uses Stream based reading and SAX based parsing internally.
* Does not support extracting styles and formatting. Just gets your data right..


# Aim of the project:
* To create a specialized library for reading spreadsheet data (different formats).
* To make it highly customized for reading, make it more faster, light-weight and hightly optimized compared to other alternatives.
